# Linux Machine setup script

My personal linux dev environment scripts in `ansible`.
For last 2 years+ my goto distro has been Pop_OS! So the setup is based on that.

## Steps
after installing a fresh Pop_OS! do the followings
```sh
./scripts/setups.sh
```

## TODO
- [ ] configure dotfiles
- [ ] maybe create own snap module

> There is a [snap](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/snap_module.html) community package, but it doesn't work at the moment!
